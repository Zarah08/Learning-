A smart contract is an unbreakable agreement which was made possible by Ethereum in 2015 but its not tottaly new a Cryptographer in 1994 had the idea.
A bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency 
The main difference between an Ethereum and a Bitcoin is the use of a smart contract 
USDC is basically a digital dollar 1USDC = 1dollar
The world of blockchain finance is called DeFi and stands for decentralized finance 
Dapp is a decentralized application 
A blockchain is a shared ledger for transactions without the need for a centralized authority 
The main problem of blockchain and smart contract is the oracle problem
An oracle is any service or device that delivers data to these decentralized blockchains, it basically connects blockchain to real world data. 
We need a decentralized oracle network because we cannot rely on a single source DON (Decentralized oracle network)
Hybrid smart contracts are smart contracts that have a combination of off chain and on chain data logic 
They are more mportant than normal smart contracts because they have a connection with the real world data 
Chailinks helps us bring off chain data onchain in a decentralized way 
Use cases: In defi applications to get current status
Insurance, flight delays, gaming
A smart contract is an agreement, contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
once a smart contract  is deployed it cannot be altered, it is automatically executed and everyone can see it
Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM is the engine that actually makes smart contracts work (OS for smart contracts)
EVM compatible vs EVM equivalent
EVM equivalent is when a chain works exactly as an Ethereum works 
EVM compatible works thesame way but may require some changes or different tooling
