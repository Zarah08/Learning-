A smart contract is an unbreakable agreement which was made possible by Ethereum in 2015 but its not tottaly new a Cryptographer in 1994 had the idea.
A bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency 
The main difference between an Ethereum and a Bitcoin is the use of a smart contract 
USDC is basically a digital dollar 1USDC = 1dollar
The world of blockchain finance is called DeFi and stands for decentralized finance 
Dapp is a decentralized application 
A blockchain is a shared ledger for transactions without the need for a centralized authority 
The main problem of blockchain and smart contract is the oracle problem
An oracle is any service or device that delivers data to these decentralized blockchains, it basically connects blockchain to real world data. 
We need a decentralized oracle network because we cannot rely on a single source DON (Decentralized oracle network)
Hybrid smart contracts are smart contracts that have a combination of off chain and on chain data logic 
They are more mportant than normal smart contracts because they have a connection with the real world data 
Chailinks helps us bring off chain data onchain in a decentralized way 
Use cases: In defi applications to get current status
Insurance, flight delays, gaming.
A smart contract is an agreement, contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
once a smart contract  is deployed it cannot be altered, it is automatically executed and everyone can see it
Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM is the engine that actually makes smart contracts work (OS for smart contracts)
EVM compatible vs EVM equivalent
EVM equivalent is when a chain works exactly as an Ethereum works 
EVM compatible works thesame way but may require some changes or different tooling

A Testnet is a blockchain that allows us to simulate trnsactions and deploy smart contracts without using real funds eg tenderly
A gas is the amount of the computational power that your transaction needs to be processed 
Gas price is the price you are willing to pay for gas 
Transaction fee = gas used * gas price
Blockchains need to prevent 3 things: 1- Sybil attacks (one person pretending to be many people) prevented using the civil resistance mechanism i.e 
proof of work and proof of stake 2- How to know if a transaction is truly immutable (final) 3- The consensus problemm which is how to get all computers 
to agree on the final state of the system

Proof of Work (PoW): Used by Bitcoin, PoW makes participation expensive through computational effort. To participate in the network's consensus, a node (or "miner") must solve a complex mathematical puzzle that requires immense computing power and electricity. An attacker can create many identities, but they cannot fake the massive real-world cost of energy and hardware required to make those identities influential.

Proof of Stake (PoS): Used by Ethereum, PoS makes participation expensive through a financial stake. To participate as a validator, a user must lock up a significant amount of the network's native cryptocurrency as collateral. An attacker is free to create multiple validator nodes, but they would need a vast amount of capital to stake for all of them. Furthermore, if they are caught acting dishonestly, their staked funds are forfeited ("slashed").

It's a common misconception to refer to PoW and PoS as consensus mechanisms themselves. Technically, they are the Sybil resistance components that are part of a larger consensus algorithm. They are the gatekeepers that ensure only those with a tangible, costly stake can participate in forming consensus.
Proof of Work (PoW) is the foundational consensus mechanism that powers pioneering blockchains like Bitcoin. To truly understand how these networks function, it's essential to grasp key concepts like mining, computational power, and the cryptographic principles that ensure their security. 
A hash is a unique, fixed-length string of characters generated from any piece of digital data. 
Mining is the process of finding solution to the blockchain problem
A block is a list of transactions mined together
A nounce is a number used to find the solution to a blockchain problem once
It is also used in ethereum to define transaction number for an account/address
In pow nodes are called miners, A fork is where the blockchain splits

Cryptography is the math behind secure communication

Private Key
The private key is the most critical piece of secret data you own. Think of it as your unique signature stamp from our analogy. It is used to create a digital signature for any message, such as a transaction.
Function: To sign and authorize transactions.
Security: Your private key must be kept secret at all times. Never share it with anyone. If someone gains access to your private key, they gain complete control over your account and can sign transactions to steal your funds.

Public Key
The public key is derived from your private key and is safe to share with others. In our analogy, this is like your public mailbox address.
Function: To allow others to verify that a signature was created by the corresponding private key.
The One-Way Relationship: You can easily generate a public key from a private key, but it is computationally impossible to reverse the process and derive a private key from a public key. 
This one-way function is what makes public verification possible without compromising your security.
ECDSA - Signatures used to seal agreements like your own personal stamp

Private keys and public keys are mathematically signed together, it is a one way mathematical relationship your public key and be used to verify the pprivate key but it does not give access to your private key.
A public key is the wallet address but a wallet address is the shortened version or hashed version of the public key

The private key is going to be used to sign messages and prove ownership
A private key has to stay private else your account can be sccessed by someone else
Ethereum key is a shorted version of public key and it is derived from the public key it is still hashed but simpler


A seed phrase is used to generate private keys, it is a master key that can be used to create all keys for unlimited doors or unlimited accounts 
Function: All of your private keys are deterministically derived from this single phrase. If you lose access to your wallet, you can restore it on any device using only your seed phrase.
Security: Protecting your seed phrase is the single most important rule of wallet security. If someone gets your seed phrase, they have access to every account and all the funds within that wallet.

POS (Prof of Stake)
The security of a Proof of Stake network is not based on computational work but on a powerful economic model. The system operates on the assumption that at least two-thirds of the total staked value is controlled by honest actors who will follow the protocol's rules.
To enforce honesty, PoS introduces a severe penalty known as slashing.
How does proof of work attain finality?
Finality in Proof of Stake (PoS) is achieved through validator voting + economic penalties, rather than brute-force computation like in Proof of Work.

Slot vs Epoch
A slot is the smallest unit of time in Ethereum PoS.
1 slot = 12 seconds
In each slot:
One validator is chosen to propose a block
Other validators attest (vote) on it

What is an epoch?
An epoch is a group of slots.
1 epoch = 32 slots
Since each slot is 12 seconds:
1 epoch = 32 × 12 = 384 seconds
That’s 6 minutes 24 seconds
Epochs are important because:
Validator rewards/penalties are calculated per epoch
Finality decisions happen at epoch boundaries
Validator duties (who proposes, who attests) are reshuffled

Staking is what incentives the validatora to act honestly like a structured reward they have to stake at least 32ETH to be able to participte in verifying transactions.
If they act maliciously their stake o rportion is slashed meaning they lose their money they get destroyed

Vulnerability attack
1- What happens when one has alot of computational power and also alot of ETH stake? This is where the 51% attack comes in 
In proof of work the 51% attack comes in when someone controls more than half of the computational power
51% attack in pos is when someone has control over 50% of the staked value in the system if someone has more than 2/3% of staked ETH they have complete control over concensus.

When history gets rewritten it is called a Blockchain reorganization or Blockchain REORG 
Reorgs happen all the time, when two miners solve the computational problem at thesame time and the blockchain spilts temporarily this is called a fork, one blockchain eventually becomes longer and wins The deeper your confirmations the more difficult it is for reorgs to undo it

MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)  attack actually occur on Ethereum 
Mempool is where pending transactions sit (a waiting room)
The person building the block validates transactions this is called the sandwich attack and is a type of MEV
Replay attacks reusing valid signatures or valid transaction just like reusing a physical cheque 

When an attacker suceeds the validators can fork out or create a different chain without the malicious transaction on it the attackers chain will automatically be abandoned.

A blockchain or protocol upgrade is a coordinated change to the rules that govern how ethereum works, just like a system upgrade but in a blockchain no company is controlling the upgrade instead all the network participants need to agree to implement it.

These protocol upgrades can alter the very core of how the blockchain functions, including:
How transactions are processed, gas fee mechanism, concensus mechanism, capabilities of smart contract, security features 

Defining Hard Forks: The Point of No Return
A hard fork is the technical process used to implement a protocol upgrade on Ethereum. Its defining characteristic is that it is not backward-compatible.

This means that after a hard fork is activated, the new rules are so different from the old rules that they are no longer compatible. Any node (a computer running the blockchain software) that has not updated to the new software will be unable to validate new blocks and transactions. These un-upgraded nodes are effectively left behind on an old, incompatible version of the chain, while the main network moves forward with the new rules
A hard fork is ethereums defense mechanism 

An update starts from EIP Ethereum Improvement Proposal, it specifies proposals to ethereum, everyone can create them 

Contentious Hard Forks (Chain Splits)
A contentious hard fork occurs when a significant portion of the community disagrees with a proposed change. This disagreement can lead to a permanent split in the blockchain, creating two separate chains that share a common history up to the point of the fork but diverge afterward.
The most famous example is The DAO Fork of 2016.
The Incident: A popular smart contract called "The DAO," a decentralized venture fund, was exploited by a hacker, resulting in the theft of approximately $150 million worth of ETH.
The Disagreement: The community was divided. One side argued for the principle of immutability—that the blockchain's history should never be altered, and "code is law," even if the outcome is unfortunate. The other side argued that the theft was a malicious attack and that the funds should be returned to their rightful owners by reversing the transactions.
The Outcome: The majority of the community voted to implement a hard fork that rewound the blockchain's state to before the attack, effectively erasing the theft. This new, upgraded chain is the one we know today as Ethereum (ETH).
The Split: A minority of the community, committed to the principle of absolute immutability, rejected the fork. They continued to operate on the original, unaltered chain, which is now known as Ethereum Classic (ETC). Both chains exist and operate independently to this day.



The People and Process Behind an Upgrade
Implementing a hard fork is a multi-step process involving several key groups:
Proposal and Consensus: An idea is formalized as an EIP and debated until it gains sufficient support from the community.
Client Implementation: Independent teams that maintain Ethereum's client software (e.g., Geth, Nethermind) implement the approved EIPs into their code. This client diversity—having multiple clients written in different languages—is a critical security feature that prevents a single bug from crippling the entire network.
Testing: The changes are rigorously tested on public testnets to ensure they work as intended.
Activation: Core developers set a specific block number for the hard fork to go live. They announce this date, giving node operators a window of several weeks to update their software.
The Fork: When the network reaches the designated block, nodes that have updated their software begin enforcing the new rules, while those that haven't are left on the old chain.

What is an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)?
An EIP, or Ethereum Improvement Proposal, is a formal design document that proposes a new feature, process, or standard for the Ethereum network. It is the primary mechanism through which anyone can suggest improvements or changes to Ethereum's core protocol, client APIs, or contract standards. Think of an EIP as a detailed blueprint for a potential upgrade. This process is open and decentralized; anyone in the community, from core developers to researchers and even informed users, can write and submit an EIP for consideration.

What is an Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC)?
An ERC, or Ethereum Request for Comment, is a specific type of EIP that focuses on creating standards at the application layer. Its primary goal is to ensure that different applications, tokens, and smart contracts built on Ethereum can interact with each other seamlessly.
The relationship is simple: all ERCs are EIPs, but not all EIPs are ERCs. This is like saying all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. ERCs are a specialized subset of EIPs dedicated to application-level functionality.

EIPs are the engine of Ethereum's evolution, providing a formal, community-driven process for upgrading the core network. ERCs are a vital subset of EIPs that create the rules for application-level interactions, fostering the interoperability that allows the ecosystem to thrive. This decentralized approach ensures that anyone with a good idea can contribute to building a better Ethereum.

Gas fees are the small amounts of ETH you pay to use Ethereum.
Any time you
send ETH
send tokens
use an app (DeFi, NFT, etc.)
you must pay a gas fee.

Why do gas fees exist?
Gas fees exist for two main reasons:
1. To pay validators
Validators are the computers that:
check transactions, keep Ethereum running, add new blocks
Gas fees are how they get rewarded for doing this work.
2. To stop spam
If transactions were free:
someone could send millions of fake transactions, the network would slow or crash
Gas fees make spamming expensive, so people only send useful transactions.

The more usage on a blockchain the higher the gas fees 
Turing complete: with limited computational power it can solve any problem that a computer can solve 
Gwai are just a fraction of ETH

Chain ID: A unique number identifying the target blockchain (e.g., 1 for Ethereum Mainnet, 111555111 for the Sepolia testnet). This crucial field prevents "replay attacks," where a transaction intended for one network could be maliciously re-broadcast on another.

Nonce: Short for "Number Used Once," the nonce is a transaction counter for the sending account, starting at 0. Each new transaction from that account must have a nonce exactly one higher than the last. This strict ordering prevents transactions from being processed out of sequence or duplicated.
Gas Parameters: These fields define the fee you are willing to pay to have your transaction processed.
Max Priority Fee Per Gas: This is the "tip" you offer directly to the validator to incentivize them to include your transaction in the next block.
Max Fee Per Gas: This sets the absolute maximum total fee (base fee + tip) you are willing to pay per unit of gas. Any difference between this max fee and the actual fee paid is refunded to you.
Gas Limit: The maximum amount of computational work (gas) your transaction is allowed to consume. This acts as a safety measure to prevent buggy smart contracts from accidentally draining your entire account balance.

MEMPOOL
When a node receives your transaction, it first performs a series of quick validation checks. It verifies the digital signature is correct and confirms that you have enough ETH in your account to cover both the transaction's value and the maximum potential gas fee.
If the transaction passes these checks, the node adds it to its local Mempool (short for Memory Pool). The mempool is best understood as a "waiting room" for valid, pending transactions that have not yet been included in a block. The node then broadcasts this transaction to its peers, and they broadcast it to theirs, ensuring it quickly propagates across the entire 
network.

This entire, intricate lifecycle applies to transactions initiated by standard user-controlled accounts, known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). Each step, from the cryptographic signature to network-wide attestation, is designed to ensure that every change to Ethereum's shared state is authorized, valid, and permanent.
