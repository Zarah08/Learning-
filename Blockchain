A smart contract is an unbreakable agreement which was made possible by Ethereum in 2015 but its not tottaly new a Cryptographer in 1994 had the idea.
A bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency 
The main difference between an Ethereum and a Bitcoin is the use of a smart contract 
USDC is basically a digital dollar 1USDC = 1dollar
The world of blockchain finance is called DeFi and stands for decentralized finance 
Dapp is a decentralized application 
A blockchain is a shared ledger for transactions without the need for a centralized authority 
The main problem of blockchain and smart contract is the oracle problem
An oracle is any service or device that delivers data to these decentralized blockchains, it basically connects blockchain to real world data. 
We need a decentralized oracle network because we cannot rely on a single source DON (Decentralized oracle network)
Hybrid smart contracts are smart contracts that have a combination of off chain and on chain data logic 
They are more mportant than normal smart contracts because they have a connection with the real world data 
Chailinks helps us bring off chain data onchain in a decentralized way 
Use cases: In defi applications to get current status
Insurance, flight delays, gaming.
A smart contract is an agreement, contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain
once a smart contract  is deployed it cannot be altered, it is automatically executed and everyone can see it
Ethereum Virtual Machine EVM is the engine that actually makes smart contracts work (OS for smart contracts)
EVM compatible vs EVM equivalent
EVM equivalent is when a chain works exactly as an Ethereum works 
EVM compatible works thesame way but may require some changes or different tooling

A Testnet is a blockchain that allows us to simulate trnsactions and deploy smart contracts without using real funds eg tenderly
A gas is the amount of the computational power that your transaction needs to be processed 
Gas price is the price you are willing to pay for gas 
Transaction fee = gas used * gas price
Blockchains need to prevent 3 things: 1- Sybil attacks (one person pretending to be many people) prevented using the civil resistance mechanism i.e 
proof of work and proof of stake 2- How to know if a transaction is truly immutable (final) 3- The consensus problemm which is how to get all computers 
to agree on the final state of the system

Proof of Work (PoW): Used by Bitcoin, PoW makes participation expensive through computational effort. To participate in the network's consensus, a node (or "miner") must solve a complex mathematical puzzle that requires immense computing power and electricity. An attacker can create many identities, but they cannot fake the massive real-world cost of energy and hardware required to make those identities influential.

Proof of Stake (PoS): Used by Ethereum, PoS makes participation expensive through a financial stake. To participate as a validator, a user must lock up a significant amount of the network's native cryptocurrency as collateral. An attacker is free to create multiple validator nodes, but they would need a vast amount of capital to stake for all of them. Furthermore, if they are caught acting dishonestly, their staked funds are forfeited ("slashed").

It's a common misconception to refer to PoW and PoS as consensus mechanisms themselves. Technically, they are the Sybil resistance components that are part of a larger consensus algorithm. They are the gatekeepers that ensure only those with a tangible, costly stake can participate in forming consensus.
Proof of Work (PoW) is the foundational consensus mechanism that powers pioneering blockchains like Bitcoin. To truly understand how these networks function, it's essential to grasp key concepts like mining, computational power, and the cryptographic principles that ensure their security. 
A hash is a unique, fixed-length string of characters generated from any piece of digital data. 
Mining is the process of finding solution to the blockchain problem
A block is a list of transactions mined together
A nounce is a number used to find the solution to a blockchain problem once
It is also used in ethereum to define transaction number for an account/address
In pow nodes are called miners, A fork is where the blockchain splits

Cryptography is the math behind secure communication

Private Key
The private key is the most critical piece of secret data you own. Think of it as your unique signature stamp from our analogy. It is used to create a digital signature for any message, such as a transaction.
Function: To sign and authorize transactions.
Security: Your private key must be kept secret at all times. Never share it with anyone. If someone gains access to your private key, they gain complete control over your account and can sign transactions to steal your funds.

Public Key
The public key is derived from your private key and is safe to share with others. In our analogy, this is like your public mailbox address.
Function: To allow others to verify that a signature was created by the corresponding private key.
The One-Way Relationship: You can easily generate a public key from a private key, but it is computationally impossible to reverse the process and derive a private key from a public key. 
This one-way function is what makes public verification possible without compromising your security.
ECDSA - Signatures used to seal agreements like your own personal stamp

Private keys and public keys are mathematically signed together, it is a one way mathematical relationship your public key and be used to verify the pprivate key but it does not give access to your private key.
A public key is the wallet address but a wallet address is the shortened version or hashed version of the public key

The private key is going to be used to sign messages and prove ownership
A private key has to stay private else your account can be sccessed by someone else
Ethereum key is a shorted version of public key and it is derived from the public key it is still hashed but simpler


A seed phrase is used to generate private keys, it is a master key that can be used to create all keys for unlimited doors or unlimited accounts 
Function: All of your private keys are deterministically derived from this single phrase. If you lose access to your wallet, you can restore it on any device using only your seed phrase.
Security: Protecting your seed phrase is the single most important rule of wallet security. If someone gets your seed phrase, they have access to every account and all the funds within that wallet.
