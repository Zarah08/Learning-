Incident vs Request are common terms in IT support and networking (especially in frameworks like ITIL). Here’s the simple difference:
🔴 Incident
An incident is when something is broken or not working as it should.
Goal: Fix it and restore normal service quickly.
Examples:
Internet is not working, Cannot login to system, Printer stopped printing, Network is down
👉 Something was working before, but now it’s broken.

🟢 Request
A request is when someone asks for something new or additional, not because something is broken.
Goal: Provide the service or access.
Examples:
Request for a new laptop, Request for Wi-Fi access, Request to install software, Request to create a new user account
👉 Nothing is broken, you just want something.

🧠 Easy way to remember (Exam Tip)
Incident	Request
Broken	Asking
Problem	Service
Fix it	Provide it
Example: Network down	Example: Need new account
