A help desk is a specialized IT team that serves as the central point of contact for employees or customers seeking support. Users can reach the help desk through online reporting tools, live chat, telephone, or shared email accounts that allow all technicians to view and respond to requests.

Help desk technicians often resolve issues quickly. For example, if there's a network outage, users may contact the help desk to ask why they can't access external sites. The technician can inform them of the outage and provide an expected resolution time.

When a support request requires further action, the technician creates a "trouble ticket" using ticketing system software to manage and track the issue. Tickets can be initiated by users via a dashboard or by technicians, with the technician validating and managing the ticket.
