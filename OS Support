Troubleshooting Display and Power Issues 
PIXELS 
A customer is frustrated with their blurry new 4K monitor. You explain that pixels, tiny red, green, and blue (RGB) dots that make up their display, determine image quality, with more pixels providing better detail.
Their blurriness likely stems from low resolution setting snot utilizing all available pixels. To fix this, search for "display resolution" and select Change the resolution of the display. Under Display resolution, select the Recommended level. This will ensure your laptop outputs the full 4K resolution your monitor supports. The figure shows this in Windows 10.

DOT PITCH
A customer reports grainy text on their new 27-inch monitor. You explain that dot pitch (distance between pixels) is likely the cause. Their monitor probably has a high dot pitch, spacing pixels farther apart and creating blurry images.
For a quick fix, search for "clear type", select Adjust ClearType text, and enable it. This optimizes text rendering for clearer reading."
For future purchases, recommend the customer consider monitors with both high resolution and low dot pitch for sharper images

CONTRAST RATIO
A customer with visual impairments asks how to adjust contrast settings on their new Windows laptop. You explain that for accessibility purposes, Windows 11 offers built-in contrast adjustment options.
This is a measurement of how white and how black a monitor can get. A contrast ratio of 1,000:1 displays dimmer whites and more pale blacks than 4,500:1. To help the customer adjust the contrast, search for "contrast", select Contrast themes, and have them turn on a contrast theme by selecting one from the dropdown menu. Options include Aquatic, Desert, Dusk, and Night sky. These themes create high-contrast displays that can make text and interface elements more visible for certain users.
If the customer needs further adjustment, they can customize these themes by clicking Edit next to your selected contrast theme. In the figure, the user is editing the Desert theme. Alternatively, you can adjust contrast directly through your monitor's On-Screen Display (OSD) menu using the physical buttons on your monitor."

ASPECT RATIO
A customer explains that when watching videos, there are black bars on the sides of the screen. They are frustrated because the video looks smaller than expected.
You explain to the customer that an incorrect aspect ratio can cause images to appear stretched or to have black bars on the sides. Using an unsupported aspect ratio can cause display distortion. This can also be an issue when an application does not automatically adjust to widescreen formats.
To adjust this, search for "display resolution" and select Change the resolution of the display. Under Display resolution, select the Recommended level. This will ensure your laptop outputs the full 4K resolution your monitor supports. The figure shows this in Windows 10.

REFRESH RATE
A customer reports their new 144Hz gaming monitor feels laggy and no smoother than their old one.
Refresh rate is expressed in Hertz (Hz) and refers to how often per second your monitor can redraw the screen. You explain to the customer that the issue is probably due to a low refresh rate. Higher refresh rates (120Hz,144Hz, 240Hz) provide smoother motion in games, while the default 60Hz can cause stuttering.
Search for "refresh rate" and then select View advance display info. If the monitor supports different refresh rates, select the drop down menu under Refresh Rate to see if the monitor supports different refresh rates. In the Figure, the Dell monitor only supports two refresh rates: 29.981 Hz and 59.997 Hz. Monitors meant for gaming will support higher refresh rates.

RESPONSE TIME
A customer reports that their gaming monitor is leaving ghost trails behind moving objects and that fast-moving characters appear blurry. This is probably due to an incorrect response time setting for the monitor. Adjusting this requires accessing the monitor's On-Screen Display (OSD) menu. This is the menu interface built into the monitor that you access using the physical buttons on the monitor itself.
At this point in the call, you will want to ask the customer for their monitor brand and model. Then you can do a quick search to find out how to change the response time for that particular monitor. In the context of fixing ghosting issues, you would use the OSD to find and adjust the "Response Time," "Overdrive," or similar setting, typically located in a gaming or performance section of the menu.

FRAMES PER SECOND FPS
A customer complains of screen tearing in video games where half of the image looks misaligned, especially, during fast movement.
You let the customer know that this could indicate the FPS need to be adjusted. If FPS is higher than the monitor's refresh rate, screen tearing (split images) can occur. If FPS is too low, motion may appear stuttered. Adaptive sync technologies (V-Sync, Free Sync, G-Sync) help to match FPS with refresh rate.
FPS adjustments are made in the settings of the installed graphics card. For NVIDIA cards, enable G-Syn in the NVIDA Control Panel. For AMD cards enable, Free Sync in the AMD Radeon Settings.

When an external monitor fails to display, check these potential causes:
-Power: Verify the monitor has power (check indicator lights). Try reseating or replacing the power cable if needed.
-Connections: Ensure display cables (HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-C) are securely connected at both ends. If using a docking station, verify it's powered and properly connected. Try a different cable to rule out cable issues.
-Windows Settings: To detect monitors, go to Settings > System > Display > Multiple Displays and click Detect. Alternatively, press Win+P and select Extend or Duplicate.
-Display Configuration: If monitors are detected but displaying improperly, adjust resolution in Settings > System > Display > Advanced display settings. Set the refresh rate to the highest supported value if experiencing flickering.
-System Reset: Restart your computer to reinitialize peripherals.
Drivers: Check Device Manager for display adapter driver updates or reinstall them if necessary.
-Hardware Testing: If the problems persist, test with a different monitor using the same connections to determine if the original monitor is faulty. Multiple failures may indicate issues with your computer's display output.

IT support technicians should understand power management capabilities in Windows so that they can help customers optimize their devices. These features improve response times, reduce energy usage, and extend device lifespans. Knowing how to configure and troubleshoot these settings will help you resolve performance issues, maximize battery life, and implement energy-saving policies across your organization.

Power Options
Lid, power & sleep button controls, allow you to configures how a computer acts when power or sleep buttons are pressed, or the lid is closed. If users do not want to completely shut down a computer, the following options may be available:
-Do nothing - The computer continues to run at full power.
-Sleep - Documents, applications, and the state of the operating system are saved in RAM. This allows the computer to power on quickly, but uses power to retain the information in RAM.
-Hibernate - Documents, applications, and the state of the operating system are saved to a temporary file on the hard drive. With this option, the computer takes a little longer to power on than the Sleep state, but does not use any power to retain the information on the hard drive.
-Shut down - Shuts down the computer.
-Turn off the display - Computer runs at full power, but the display is turned off. This option is not shown in the figure because it is not available on laptops.

BitLocker is Microsoft's full disk encryption feature built into Windows operating systems that provides robust data protection for your computer. First introduced with Windows Vista, this security tool encrypts entire drives using advanced encryption standards, preventing unauthorized access to your data in case your device is lost, stolen, or compromised. By requiring authentication before decrypting the drive through a password, PIN, USB key, or TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, BitLocker creates a powerful barrier against data theft, giving users peace of mind that their sensitive information remains secure even if physical access to their device is obtained by malicious actors.
BitLocker recovery keys can be found in several places, depending on how your Windows system is set up:

Microsoft Account: If you're using a Microsoft account with your Windows device, recovery keys are typically saved there automatically. Check at account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey
Azure AD/Microsoft 365: In organizational settings, IT administrators may store BitLocker keys in Azure AD. Users might need to contact IT support.
Local storage: If saved locally, check for a text file containing the recovery key, often on an external USB drive or printed document created during BitLocker setup.
Group Policy: In business environments, recovery information might be stored according to organizational policy.
